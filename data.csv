"1038","Rhododendron Dieback, Floyd Co., VA","","Wednesday, November 2, 2016","Disease","11/02/2016, Christie:  Looking across the imagery timeline in the PDF, it is not that obvious if we can document a reduction in the evergreen understory.  Complicating the interpretation is the unknown extent and proportion of mixed forest present.  Subjectively, I perceive a slight tonal change of veg (inside the parcel denoted) in the latter dates of imagery, though this is speculative.
The last page of the PDF is a screenshot taken from the ForWarn Forest Change and Assessment Viewer application, demonstrating the use of the ‘Graph NDVI’ tool to present historical NDVI values in graph form.  It appears that starting generally around 2010-2012 and going forward, a reduction in the winter NDVI minima.  This is the best supporting evidence and could potentially indicate the gradual loss of the evergreen (rhodo) understory.
10/26/2016, Norman:  With a disease complex, sometimes the proximate cause can be clear, but varied; yet the fundamental reason for the dieback might be stress from historical long-term changes. Note they report that “greater dieback ratings were associated with significantly greater tree diameters”. If these were old growth areas, that is likely a novel pathogen or disease, I’d think, as the rhododendron has likely always been there unless it came in after the Chestnut blight heavily. But if this mortality is in areas that were logged and we’re talking maturing second growth, it might just be a type of successional transition.  Rhodos like shade, but they don’t like too much drought, and competition contributes to drought stress.

Abstract
Rhododendron dieback was continuously observed with increasing frequency on Rhododendron maximum (Rosebay Rhododendron) during the last 20 years in the southern Appalachian Mountains. The dieback was especially evident following several years of drought from 2004 to 2008 recorded in Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM). With the concern that a disease epidemic could occur, a holistic study evaluated site factors including tree health, number of clonal units, aspect, slope, depth to bedrock, and rhizosphere microbes. This study was conducted at two locations: Laurel Falls in GRSM and Albert Mountain in Nantahala National Forest (NNF). Yearly sampling for nematodes showed no differences in frequencies across or between years. A total of 11 species were identified from replicated healthy and dieback plots with no significant trends observed. Criconemella xenophus, Helicotylenchus sp., and Meloidogyne sp. were the species most commonly found. Belonolaimus sp. occurred at the NNF site at below 1% of the total nematode population identified, but this nematode species is considered damaging to crops and forest nursery seedlings even at low numbers. Fungal/Oomycota diversity and densities were determined from roots and rhzosphere soil samples using three identification methods. The results ranged from 110 species of fungi to 0 for Oomycota. Of 110 fungi isolated, one putative root pathogen was identified, and the saprophytic species Mycena silvae-nigrae (unknown Basidiomycota 1) was the most common match using the GenBank database. Elevation at NNF was significantly greater than at GRSM, with significantly greater dieback levels at the higher elevation. Furthermore, greater dieback ratings were associated with significantly greater tree diameters. No trends were observed for percent slope or nutrient levels when compared between healthy and dieback sites or locations. Site factors such as aspect, elevation, associated nematode species, and a putative root pathogen may form a disease complex resulting in Rosebay Rhododendron dieback.

"1037","Hurricane Matthew Flooding, SE Coastal Plain 10/2014","","Friday, October 7, 2016 to Monday, October 31, 2016","Flooding","10/17/2016, Norman: ForWarn’s latest Early Detect is showing the bottomland areas affected by Hurricane Matthew flooding remarkably well, but damage, per se, needs to wait and may be elusive given seasonal senescence.
To know what is “known”, the recent stream flow pattern from USGS WaterWatch (under Map Layers/Additional Assessment Maps/Hydrography) gives the general pattern, though peak flow may have preceded this week’s window.http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav2?theme=MODIS_Forest_Change_Product...
For disaster declaration areas that are a powerful indicator of human impacts ($1.5B in NC alone):
NC: https://gis.fema.gov/maps/dec_4285.pdf
SC: https://gis.fema.gov/maps/dec_4286.pdf
GA: https://gis.fema.gov/maps/dec_4284.pdf
FL: https://gis.fema.gov/maps/dec_4283.pdf
Today is the 17th, and so since the event there are only a few clear days available. With Early Detect, we  still might be picking up pre-storm pixels if it has stayed cloudy in the affected area. So has it?  Matthew left short in NC on October 9, and on that early date, it looks like we had a clear view for all but the NE corner of NC then and also the 10th, mostly the 11th, some on the 12th, all the coastal areas of SC and NC on the 13th, with clouds again on the 14th : http://activefiremaps.fs.fed.us/imagery.php?op=fire&passID=342482   With this sequence, ED should give a pretty crisp view of state of things post-hurricane.
So what do we see? The natural (forest, shrub, grass, wetland) and urban areas have strong anomalies along all the primary coastal plain river bottoms that are new in the current ED product for 20161014 http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav2?theme=MODIS_Forest_Change_Product...   Agricultural areas have a lot of pre-hurricane anomalies that relate to either season-long crop rotation, early harvest, or less productive harvest, so I don’t have confidence in ForWarn’s estimation of that damage.  Natural areas show patterns that are expected.
ROANOKE RIVER BOTTOMLANDS
Note in particular the Roanoke River area.  The scattered red blocks with relatively sharp edges are probably clearcuts, while the bottom land flooding is water-over-vegetation. I see no reason to think of this as damage, however, as this area often floods in the fall with reservoir releases that give us strong anomaly signals here especially in the lower areas close to sea level:  http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/highlights/1005  See in particular this Highlight slide:  http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/sites/default/files/field/image/Slide18...
Interactive view of Roanoke Bottoms: http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav2?theme=MODIS_Forest_Change_Product...
PAMLICO-ALBEMARLE AREA
Toggling the Early Detect between 10/14 and 9/28 gives a suggestion of possible damage to low lying exposed areas and on the more exposed Barrier Island.  Some of this decline pre-dated the storm in recent months, so toggling is critical here.  Anomalies can jump around in these lands a bit too, yet I see suspectable damage in the aforementioned most exposed areas that could go beyond just wet-over-veg or flooding.  We sometimes get salt water intrusion in the more exposed edges that could lead to subsequent declines as wee saw from Hurricane Irene in 2011 (See highlight 142 here http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/highlights/142).
Interactive view: http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav2?theme=MODIS_Forest_Change_Product...
PEE DEE, HAW, etc. BOTTOMLANDS near SC-NC border
The Early Detect for 10/14/16 has brought out the bottom signatures strongly at least up to the fall line. As in the Roanoke, these bottoms often experience flooding, and it is interesting to see the “paternoster wetlands” where water is deeper forming along the bottomlands’ lengths.  Generally, the darker red inundated areas form closer to sea level where the gradient has dropped.    http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav2?theme=MODIS_Forest_Change_Product...
SANTEE SC: This bottomland downstream of Lake Marion is not as affected, possibly because of water management upstream that departs from that farther north (we’ve seen that pattern of reduced flooding impacts from storms on the Santee before). http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav2?theme=MODIS_Forest_Change_Product...
OGEECHEE (SC-GA border upstream of Savannah)
Higher waters are visible here, but not necessarily damage. Most of the urban and nonbottomland anomalies pre-date the storm on the Early Detect, but don’t show up on the current Oct 14 1 year outside of clearcuts and the city, so they might just reflect methodological issues with the ED.http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav2?theme=MODIS_Forest_Change_Product...
NE FLORIDA
Florida is always tough, even with the normal 1 year baseline, but some of the anomalies here on the most recent Early Detect could be associated with the storm, however, FL is always tough.  http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav2?theme=MODIS_Forest_Change_Product...
The FDM also shows bottomland anomalies in NC and SC, but with fewer anomalies along many portions of the coast perhaps because conditions are sometimes pre-disturbance in their two week window. NW Florida shows an interesting change during the last two periods on the FDM, though it is also hard to interpret given how hard FL generally is always:http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav2?theme=MODIS_Forest_Change_Product...http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav2?theme=MODIS_Forest_Change_Product...
SUMMARY
Overall, I’m not prepared to say we’re seeing anything more than bottomland or wetland flooding in the ED, but  I think we map the intensity of that very well, and given the imagery available, the ED is going to pick up the post-Matthew dates, while the 1 year standard product is still pre-Matthew in most cases because of seasonal declines plus any disturbance declines as it lacks the requirement of recentness. The uplands have been shifting a lot in the Early Detect in prior weeks, so it is hard to make sense of that, it’s far too early to map wind disturbance, if we ever will see it given how late in the year it is (unless it is damage to conifers), even though from the available MODIS (RSAC links above) we know we have recent clear views. Of those non-riparian areas, the Pamlico area in NC (wetlands) and Horry Co., SC, Columbus, Pender and Onslow Counties are worth watching particularly closely when the standard product becomes available for the post-storm window.
In terms of drought relief, such as we observed in earlier season storms in prior years, note that drought has been severe in the TN-NC-AL-GA-SC intersection area far to the west of the Coastal Plain, but these areas didn’t get much relief from the storm as near as I can tell. Here in Asheville we got virtually nothing out of this event.  Plus, it’s too late in the year to have a  greening response in forests, however it is possible in grassy areas until it gets cold, so that response in open non-crop cover types is something to look for. http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav2?theme=MODIS_Forest_Change_Product... . (We can’t readily tell what areas got what precipitation under the Other Weather and Climate Menu (NOAA NWS) as those live links have been deactivated once again.)

"1035","Rim Fire, Portions of Stanislaus NF and Yosemite NP, CA","","Thursday, September 4, 2014 to Monday, September 19, 2016","Fire, Silviculture","09/16/2016, Spruce: Attached is are slides that compare the 2015 duration product to the 1 year NDVI change for a date in the duration temporal window. There are also comparisons to Landsat true color RGBs from September of 2014, 2015, and 2016. It looks like the anomaly on the duration product is related to post burn land management efforts. It seems like they removed a lot o vegetation, leaving a large cleared polygon of which the anomaly is a subset in which it is even more cleared. There is also NDVI decline for date of 1 year change product for 9/4/16 that includes areas that were burned but do not show indications of being cleared...
On the Landsat true color imagery (path 43 row 34) south of the duration anomaly there are areas with NDVI decline on the 9/4/16 change map that are showing up as dead red forest on the Landsat. I didn't make any slides for that, though it may be useful for possibly re-engaging USFS NFs etc. about ForWarn products covering the CA forest mortality zone...
September 12, 2016, Hargrove: what about possible soil erosion/loss of topsoil following the severe burn; then you lose even the shrubs and herbs ...
09/12/2016, Norman, Steve -FS wrote: Some decline certainly could be secondary mortality from bark beetles  (if all the trees weren’t killed by hot fire), as that is a widely  recognized phenomenon in fires of the west and in the SN in particular.  However the NDVI severity suggests that fire was rather hot here and to  contribute to such a sharp decline in subsequent years would mean mass  beetle mortality within a mass severely burned patch. The tight edge and  shape of this suggests that secondary mortality from beetles is not the  primary cause. Just to the West of this area on the administered  Stanislaus NF, there may be scattered secondary mortality here at a  scale that is more like what I’d expect from this system:
http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav2?theme=Duration&layers=DUBAA,AAB&m...
A large part of the 2015 affected area is/was relatively dense conifer  (below), but areas that were logged not long ago (based on the aerial) are also departed, but often less perhaps because they were earlier in the year than afforded by the 12 week Duration window. Note by comparing the multigraph and aerial that these visible clearcuts have no pre-fire decline in NDVI, suggesting that they are post fire. Drought may exaggerate the response or progression rate somewhat, but the primary decline is fire mortality, then based on there being a fresh clearcut, that was followed by ground disruption from salvage logging.
Note from the forest mask (below) and the shaded areas of the US TOPO map, that this area is OUTSIDE the administered NF, even though it is within the Proclaimed boundary; hence it is open for salvage logging without the NEPA constraints that restrict or slow response of public lands. From the TOPO, there are ready logging roads already in this patch, so removal on private land is predictively rapid, consistent with observations. We have no logging or fuels treatment data for non-FS lands on the viewer or otherwise. Therefore, as this is state or private land, I am now even more convinced than before that this is salvage logging post Rim-Fire. It is a textbook example, and NDVI response I’d say, as evidenced by its shape, location, timing and aerial imagery.
 Note also, as expected, that FS salvage logginghttp://www.sierraforestlegacy.org/Resources/Conservation/ProjectsPlans/C...
 is largely tied up in the courts: https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=rim+fire+salvage+logging+jawbone+creek
September 12, 2016, Spruce:  I think this is quite possibly related to further stand degradation in a localized area that took place after the fire in lieu of the ensuing drought. Dead snags falling down and soil erosion in a semi-arid area with harsh growing conditions since the fire. This seems like what we saw in the FCAV for portions of the Hayman fire burn scar in CO. For the CA Rim fire and this anomaly, maybe a wind storm came through.
I noticed that the fuel treatment maps in the FCAV do not show activity in this particular location, though there are polygons in adjacent
areas. I am not sure if the FCAV's fuel treatment map is up to date, however.
In another study I participated in the late 1990s, I saw first hand evidence of a differential forest recovery from wildfire in the NE portion of Yellowstone NP that got impacted by big 1988 wildfire. Some areas that dead trees were still standing whereas others had more fallen trees. Also the regeneration varied.
For this CA burn area and the anomaly in question, it seems like most of the anomaly had severe NDVI decline as of 9/4/2014:
http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav2?theme=Duration&layers=DUBAA,NRTBK...
It seems like comparison to current higher resolution RS data (e.g., NAIP if available) would be useful to assess further...
On 09/12/2016 Hargrove wrote: and no forest composition correlations spatially either; so i guess has to be post-fire tree harvest? But why not a greater size? and why not harder edges?
On 09/12/2016, Norman, Steve: Actually, I think the edges are rather hard compared to other causes, such that it has a rather distinct boundary. Note the irregular topography here, which makes a quilt-like harvesting grid not the expectation, so partial salvage treatment in some MODIS cells is likely given that sensitive slopes are avoided. We have FS harvest data, actual and planned, so there is no reason to guess. BC can look at it, but we don't have it up on the viewer for easy vetting.
Also, the weekly evolution of this anomaly will convincingly build a case for harvesting versus other causes. I haven't had time to go back to trace it, except looking on the multigraph which suggests a slow decline.
I can think of no alternative cause of a patch anomaly other than activity. If it was secondary beetle kill or delayed tree mortality, it wouldn't be such a coherent patch. This is a west aspect mostly, I think, which is likely intermediate in drought stress, but drought stress should be diffuse, not patchy.
On 9/12/2016 9:18 AM, Norman, Steve -FS wrote: This may be a fantastic example of back to back disturbances. On the 12 week summer Duration map, the fire area is largely all deep red, as it should be with a decrease in NDVI part of a year earlier. However, in 2015, there was a severe persistent decline west of Cherry Lake and Lake Eleanor by the Woods Ridge Lookout Tower. I think this is some type of secondary FS management, though the fuels layers don't map this out to be as much. Perhaps the Clearcut layer would.
Check out the multigraphs from this 2015 dark area vs the surroundings where NDVI recovery was not delayed, consistent with the Duration maps.

"1034","Fremont NF, OR, NDVI decline anomaly ","","Wednesday, September 14, 2016","Drought, Insects, Silviculture, Unknown","09/14/16, Christie: , I pulled a recent Landsat (08/14/16) from the Landsat Viewer; and showing the FW most recent (09/12/16) all year for comparison.  I displayed FS Timber Harvest on the desktop and confirmed there are no harvest activities in the 04/2016 version of FS Timber Harvest dataset (graphic provided).
09/07/16, Spruce: The anomaly is a broad, extensive red blob in an area in an area without a large fire superimposed. A fair amount of it is in National Forest not tagged for wilderness land use. I think there should be a group of end-users in the operational side of the USFS in the NFS that would be interested in this monitoring capability finding, though there is not much of a trail to such end-users at present. I believe a way to make the info more relevant is to aggregate per pixel findings into a zonal map representative of a management unit, such as timber compartment map.  Another management unit would be a finer scaled HUC watershed.  Not sure where to go from here, though the there is a lot of language out there about the USFS promoting sustainable forests. To me also, this could be an early indication of climate change in which these declining forests are transitioning to more of a woodland state.
09/05/16, Norman: Many of the forests that died in these areas 8-10 years ago are unlikely under to see recovery to early 2000s conditions, as the trees that died typically established 90-120 years ago when the area was heavily grazed. There could be young establishment in some sections that evaded the beetles, but ForWarn is ill-equiped to pick up on that unless it’s around for another 5-10 years perhaps, given how slow growth rates are here. Given that this forest was overly dense due to its history, that “recovery” would be deemed a management failure and instead the standard for a desirable response should be with a lower target NDVI and a slower recovery rate than we’ve seen in more productive forest climates.
So in an area like this: http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav2?theme=CONUS_Vegetation_Monitoring...  I’d expect “resiliency” or a restoration goal to have an NDVI non-grassy peaked max no higher than .60 (it was 0.65), with plenty of winter-summer amplitude remaining despite being coniferous. Prior to defoliation, this was caused by a combination of grass (climate-grass productivity dynamics are clearly visible in the occasional peaks prior to beetles) and marginal snowpack in winter visible through the canopy (if winters continue to have snow, given climate change).
However, by the look of the multigraph in that area, you are right to identify this as a likely area lacking evidence of recovery. I’m struck by the loss of grassy peaks that must either result from persistent drought after 2009 or a weak understory flora. That summer NDVI remains as high as it is suggests that there are still likely seed trees here and maybe younger pine that were preferentially not killed. Compare the reduction in the growing season over the era, which relates to canopy cover loss of pines.
Mostly based on the NDVI below through 2015, I would put a site like this on a “Forest recovery/resiliency watch list”; something we need to develop annually as part of a long-term monitoring product. Right now the larger team has at least two general approaches to get there: DCL and BJB are looking at these questions from a successional landscape perspective such that recovery in one cell needs to be balanced by what is going on in the neighborhood. Alternatively, given that “tree sites” are not random in the landscape, I’m more concerned with the collective response of individual grid cells. I think the concern in this type of system is whenever a single stand or landscape of pine forest that was resilient here with frequent fire for centuries suddenly goes away. There is no room in my mind for a shifting mosaic stead state in this system from which “resilience” can emerge because I have as a starting assumption that trees are preferentially in areas that they favor and that frequent fire has a sustaining effect through thinning for more drought and beetle resistance.
09/02/16, Spruce: NDVI decline anomaly that occurs in a part of the Fremont NF in OR when using the all year max NDVI baseline. It is for an area hit by MPB in 2004-2010 that still has not recovered its former vegetation canopy greenness. The area includes deep red decline anomaly for largely excludes fire scars and fuel load mitigation polygons.  I think this is a situation that can be common in the western US - bark beetle damage in dry forests that occurred earlier in the MODIS era that includes sizeable areas not recovering in terms of vegetation canopy greenness.  One question that FW change products could help address is whether or not western US forests with frequent overstory mortality are recovering in terms of vegetation canopy greenness...

"1032","Superior National Forest Storm Event","","Friday, July 22, 2016","Weather","09/08/16, Spruce: As you know, with Landsat data, the temporal resolution is often non-optimal for mapping all desired disturbances, though useable for showing where the harvests are at a 30m scale. Nonetheless, practicioners  try different techniques on the best available Landsat data to produce needed change products.  The results can be of variable quality, depending on the technique, situation, and info need.
There are many ways to process the Landsat data for disturbance detection applications. To suppress phenological differences between pre/post Landsat dates that acquired at different times of year (or different types of years - e.g., drought or wet year), one can derive a Landsat change product that is normalized according to mean global change. It also helps to rescale the data to reflectance and to correct reflectances for atmospheric contamination. In addition, the type of change metric matters.  A lot of experts just difference a given spectral index. Others normalize the difference according to a normal indicative of a pre-disturbed state. For FW products, we normalized the difference by whatever is used for the baseline.
It would help to know specifically what dates were used in the Landsat analysis and how the product was constructed. However, one can get a good idea of what Landsat is picking up without that info. Clearcuts and partial harvests should be apparent on the Landsat data.  One can spatially average the Landsat data to a MODIS scale to gauge the effects of spatial resolution on the detectability of the fine scaled disturbances.  The MODIS data should show the hot spots where the storm damage is more pronounced and severe, though probably will not be able to show much indication of adjacent areas with more minor damage.
I am not at NASA SSC today, though will be tomorrow. I can pull some Landsat data to further QA the MODIS product in question then. I can relay initial findings tomorrow sometime.
There is also now ESA Sentinel 2 multispectral imagery at 10 m resolution  that could be helpful for checking Landsat...This data is searchable on and downloadable from USGS GLOVIS. This system's data includes a red edge spectral band that can help in vegetation disturbance detection. See http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentine... for related info. The coverage for the US is currently spotty. I haven't checked to see if there is data for this MN study area.
09/08/16, Norman: The MN Landsat used as “current” in the County analyst’s change detection effort was clearly this one dated 22 July 2016; http://landsatlook.usgs.gov/viewer.html / . For the baseline, there is a decent June 20 image (with sparse cumulus) ; then one for 15 Sep 2015 (a bit late seasonally, given the latitude), a great one 14 Aug 2015, which was probably the one used as their baseline unless it was 4 Jul 2015 which has some clouds and maybe haze, but is otherwise clear.  The better of either would be valid change science.
Gus’ concern was change that occurred prior to the big event. Other than filtering out what can be filtered with the June 20 2016 image, I don’t know how to overcome this using Landsat. I suppose he was concerned about logging or earlier storm damage, but the latter concern, if it impacted fuels, is not a problem, I would think. Logging would be. It should be possible to use ForWarn to filter the timing of change, though the Landsat effort included several pixels that would have been scattered with low impact on ForWarn, and we see areas they map not showing up in ForWarn (and vice versa).
09/06/16, Gus Smith, District Ranger, Superior National Forest, Kawishiwi Ranger District: We have seen an NDVI analysis but the guy used a “pre” image from 2015, so it includes a lot of disturbance noise that isn’t related to the blowdown in July. If you know a way we could get a tighter comparison window, please let me know. Resolution on the Landsat images would help with unit (burn/timber) level planning.

"1030","Isle Royale National Park, MI","potential forest disturbance due to insects or severe weather
","Monday, August 29, 2016","Insects, Unknown, Weather","08/29/16, Spruce: Given the featured ForWarn MMAX change product is showing only an ~ -2% drop in NDVI, to me this area should be watched as opposed to issuing an alert for to see if a bigger, sustained NDVI decline develops.  I am not sure what the nature of this anomaly, though storm damage could be a factor as well. The persistence of the anomaly makes it seem like it is something real, though the ability of MODIS to measure NDVI has been described by some on the MODIS science team (e.g., Huete et al. 2006 in the MOD13 ATBD document - attached) as +/- ~1% just considering the band to band registration between the NIR and the Red. In addition, there is 2 NDVI products needed to derive the change map so errors can be compounded.  Also, data quality of the input products and duration of the observed change are factors.
Attached is an enhancement of the Landsat RGB done with MS Office Picture Manager in which the brightness was decreased 25 increments and contrast increased 25 increments. It results in enhancing the location of conifer dominated forest (shown in chocolate brown tones)...
08/29/16, Norman: I’m not sure the Landsat tells us anything though as this is odd vegetation affected (possibly lots of aspen) which may have a reflectance which without a baseline could falsely appear stressed if you’re expecting normal deciduous or conifer vegetation.
It starts to appear on 7/18 on both the Early Detect and Standard 1 year.  I like the way it shows on the Mean better. It may be there as early as 7/10.
As the greater region has experienced some severe storms through July—as we’ve seen across northern MN--it could well be storm damage, especially given that this is such an exposed, higher elevation site. I’d not expect a storm report here, though, as neither moose nor wolves are reliably Internet users.  My expectation is that this is storm damage or hardwood insect/disease stress.
08/29/16, Norman: In support of the regionally-consistent July wind storm argument, note the topographic position of the area earliest affected on the Mean BL: 0726_2016 on Sugar Mountain. Given the fetch of L Superior and the enhanced vulnerability of these emerging hills, this pattern is consistent with exposure. That said, elsewhere in this region in recent years, we have seemed to see wetland trees more vulnerable to blowdown, presumably because of their shallow rooting, and topo positions also often have vegetation types that are more or less vulnerable to selected defoliation.

This minor anomaly in Isle Royale, in L Superior has been  present for quite a while. This is an interesting place. From ADS, has had mapped birch and aspen decline irregularly in the past,  but also spruce budworm in 2006 on a peninsula to the SE.  No drought. Past fire scars make habitat variable, but from the aerial, most canopies in this affected area appear to be hardwood.  Gap says northern hardwood, which is often a catch-all type that doesn’t reflect the patchiness of hemlock or spruce of the mixed hardwood-conifer composition. True color suggests not clouds either.
There may be some nice Landsat of this interesting wild area available

"1027","Santa Fe National Forest, NM","NDVI decline anomaly in Santa Fe NF near Santa Fe, NM, including portions of Sangre de Cristo Mountains
","Tuesday, August 2, 2016","Insects","08/02/16, Norman: While a rolling duration would be nice, we need to keep in mind that for many of our uses, fewer maps and more seasonally digested products are what they need/only have time/patience for, unfortunately. The existing Duration dates are weakest, conceptually, in the West, but there is the complexity in the west of having less well-aligned vegetative and disturbance phenologies that make “eastern” conceptualizations of impacts quite a bit more challenging.  Right now, western duration maps show fires according to their onset time within the window, not impacts to the growing season as fires largely occur after the growing season is over, even after late summer/fall dormancy. In such situations, duration provides a “noise filterer” more than an impact predictor, the latter of which is the richer gold I’m digging for with the concept.   In the east, duration of an insect outbreak can also show onset and development, but since we’re looking during the actual growing season, this equates to the fraction of the growing season interrupted, not just onset time.  Put another way, onset time is meaningful for low to moderate disturbances that have a potential for within-season regrowth or when disturbances cut growth off at mid season. While I see clear utilitarian limits to the concept as applied to the coniferous west, it does provide a way to isolate anomaly persistence there despite clouds or atmospheric issues and it may help isolate the subtle declines of partial defoliation in conifer forests that lack grassy understories.  I’ve seen nice examples of fuels treatments coming out and low severity prescribed fire that are often ephemeral on the standard severity-magnitude products.
I’m really curious to see Bill’s change in area under the growing season curve as a third, but interrelated measure of impact. In terms of interpretability of impacts, it will still suffer from the problem of misalignment of disturbance and veg phenology in the West (and sometimes the east), but it may be quite powerful.
I think this is quite likely insects here in NM.  Comparing prior years ForWarn  with ADS here, like elsewhere in the West, gives mixed results, however. We’re not mapping everything they “see” and we’re seeing anomalies that they’re not mapping. Whether this is limitations of both or more heavily on one technology probably has no clear answer—that is, the answer differs place to place and event to event. The closer we can hand them a product that looks like ADS, or a raster version of ADS with severity, the happier they will be.
08/02/16, Spruce: To me, the last 3 dates show some - not quite a bit of - jumpiness, - not a lot in my opinion in that the last 3 dates are essentially showing the same areas with anomalies. The amount of jumpiness is minor to me with understandable amounts of minor fluctuation in the area with the anomaly. The aerial image shows relatively thick forest. While it may help to wait another week, I do not think we need fixed duration products to all of justify sending an alert about a NDVI decline anomaly. Although useful for a good range of situations and locations, these duration products may need to be done on rolling window to be more useful for all regions (e.g., western US). Also, there are seasonal fluctuations to be considered.  A lot of the ADS polygons shown below are at an elevation lower than where the anomaly is occurring. Anyways, let's see what the next date of product indicates for this area...
08/02/16, Norman: Note that this is about 1000 feet above the 2004 Pinyon Ips outbreak (shown below), but they were higher up in 2013 a bit,. The smaller 2004 mapped areas are Douglas Fir beetles.  Also, in 2009, 2010 and 2015, the Western Spruce Budworm is active in the current anomaly zone.  In 2014, it was fir engraver. In 2013-4  it was aspen damage.
There is a lot going on here, plus its abnormally dry at present. Some insect cause seems likely at work if for no reason other than they are always in the mix.  The hashed area east of Santa Fe that’s covered up below is a fire.
Note that the anomaly locations jump around quite a bit among periods with a few exceptions.  In a week, the early-mid summer duration product for the six weeks ending 8/4 will let us “see through” this jumpiness a bit.
08/02/16, Spruce: Certain coniferous forests east of Santa Fe NM in Santa Fe NF are showing NDVI decline anomalies for the past 3 dates. In particular, the MMAX change images for the 3 most current dates show more or less same area ""lighting up"" with NDVI decline relative to the surrounding area rated as being neutral or greener than average. The recent years of ADS indicates a minor amount of WSBW and Fir Engraver beetle damage in portions of the anomaly (assemblage of patches with decline in the area of concern). It could be bark beetle related.
The area on Landfire/GAP map has ponderosa pine in lower elevations, mixed conifer forest in the upper elevations a few scattered small areas with aspen - includes portions of Sangre de Cristo Mountains. The RSAC forest type map indicates a lot of ponderosa pine. Most of NDVI decline anomaly area has not been recorded as being hit before by insects during the MODIS era.  I am not sure what is the nature of the anomaly but think it might be something hitting the ponderosa pine component.
The MMAX change map is perhaps a conservative indicator in this case but is very clean relative to the other change maps. I think it shows the hot spots, which seems like potentially useful to resource managers.  Given that there is not much ADS mapped area in the anomaly location with minimal history of previous known insect disturbance, I think it is a good metric for showing new disturbance.
I included the GEOMAC fire map for 2000-2015 to exclude these areas from consideration. It seems like the current fire data for this year is still out of date in FW, though I do not think current year fire is a factor in this case. The current MODIS true color RGB looks to be of good quality overall. The area looks to be of brown tone on the MODIS true color, suggesting dry conditions. The whole area is rated as abnormally dry on the latest US Drought Monitor map.

","Friday, July 8, 2016 to Tuesday, August 2, 2016","Weather","08/01/16, Norman: Yes, based on shape, scale and severity pattern, this is for me a classic hail-wind streak.  As it is apparent on the Jun 25-Jul 18 Early Detect, it had to occur at least before July 19th.
Based on NOAA NWS Storm reports, it had to have been this event on July 8, 2016: http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/160708_rpts.html as there are no comparable storm-day alternatives in northern Michigan. Note that between 5 and 5:11 PM, they had 1 to 1.75” hail near Atlanta and Lewiston, Montmorency County. Also 1” hail 5 miles south of Hillman.   That is certainly enough to cause the damage we see to forests.  News reports confirm the severity, but none that I can find, describe impacts to natural forests. They report that up to baseball size hail, three inch diameter, fell near Glen Arbor. Note that the damage we see from 7/8 affected Mackinaw State Forest.
08/01/16, Spruce: I noticed on the last 2 dates of ED change products that there are moderate to high severity NDVI decline occurring as linear features in Montmorency and Alpena Counties, MI that I think are possibly related to storm damage. These features appear to be occurring linearly from SW to NE, comparable to what we have seen previously with severe storm hail/wind damage events.  However, I am not sure about causal agent. The ED true color RGB for the current date is excellent. The last 2 dates of ED change products more or less record the same features, albeit with slightly different NDVI decline levels.  These features have not yet showed up on the MVC change products. It seems like this set of anomalies may all occur outside of NF lands. See below FW URLs for additional info.

Gas well development is patchy, and we see that all over on both ag and forest (often State Forest) lands in PA in ForWarn because of Marcelles Shale exploitation, but as the pipelines go in, there can be a lot more area and forest fragmentation going on too. This is seemingly a good example of that here.

"1023","Hiawatha NF, eastern Mackinac County, MI","","Wednesday, July 13, 2016","Insects","07/14/16, Norman: This is an interesting example because the worst hit areas are seemingly in a lowland area, with strong topo-conformity. Historically (i.e., IDS since 2000) maps spruce budworm and FTC in the areas outside this current hard hit area, but rarely/barely in it. The yellow is beech bark disease, which I don’t think would show up on the 1 year so strongly.  I note in the area hardest hit in this ADS window, there is a major dip in 2008 that is unmapped.
GAP maps it (and the surroundings that look completely different from the aerial as “Northern Hardwoods”. While the trees in this “type” can vary, it may be that there are abundant black cherry, which are a primary host of FTC.  The bottom area, currently affected had/had beech, probably lots of maple, some birch, maybe some hemlock (though the multigraph has large seasonal amplitude, suggesting not much of that), and other misc hardwoods.  I note that the surrounding uplands that are also mapped as “Northern Hardwoods” have a stronger NDVI-defined conifer component, so that would be where the spruce is (as supported by ADS’ polygons since 2000 too).
Bottom line, I don’t think this is spruce budworm here, but I don’t know what it is, nor if it is even biotic.
2008 12 week summer departure duration @3% shows an extreme decline that from the multigraph and 2006 12 week duration appears to have started in 2006.  While phenomenon that have a similar footprint may have similar cause, there may be multiple causes that affect this wetter site. For example, a windstorm might affect it differently if the soil is more saturated or if there are trees with different vulnerabilities.

07/27/16, Christie: alert sent to Red Lake Indian Nation, MN, copying Brian Schwingle, MN DNR for their adjacent State Forests
07/25/16, Norman: I first thought that the variable intensity along the track might be due to storm behavior—say if it was a linear wind storm, there was a chance convergence of winds or a spotty downdraft causing this epicenter of damage in red along the west to east trajectory, but looking at the topo and multigraph, you can see that this site was likely more treed and on a moraine above the wetlands. That suggests that site vulnerability may be a better explanation for differences in magnitude than meteorological variability.  Blowdown is often increased when the soil is saturated, but he we see the reverse, with more damage to the ever so slightly elevated uplands. There are likely differences in tree species across this landscape.
Also note that this seems to be part of the Red Lake Indian Reservation.

I noticed that in the last 2 dates of ED products there is some intensification in the NDVI decline for these.

The 3 year change product is comparable to the 5 year change product. The All Year Change shows the same anomalies and a few more. The 2010 NALCMS land cover shows these areas as either being hardwood or softwood forest. It is possible that these 3 anomalies together could also be related to a mixture of damage agents.

Just wanted you to know that the two map extents below were hail damage from a storm back on May 10th. I was notified of the damage on the first link from field reports of defoliated trees. I looked it up using ForWarn and was able to match the extent of the damage I saw on the ground with the satellite map. I then used ForWarn to look for other areas of possible hail damage and found the second link below. I visited that site and also found defoliation from hail.

"1013","Mt Baldy, Apache NF, AZ anomaly","","Thursday, June 16, 2016","Unknown","06/16/2016, Spruce: Based on ADS data, this kind of defoliation was particularly apparent at the area of interest in 2003.  Maybe it is cyclical. The anomaly seems to be at least partially visually correlated with what ADS mapped in 2003. It also matches up in terms of the spruce fir cover type in the GAP/Landfire LC map.
06/16/2016, Norman: Interesting sapsucker, this Spruce Aphid is. It was mapped here on Mt Baldy last year, 2015, then in 2011 too. It’s a European-originating NNIS with some research on it. The passage below from Lynch 2009 relates to the seasonality of the active defoliation—apparently spring to early summer, which is what we’re seeing.  See also p 320 (seasonal life history).
From http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_other/rmrs_2009_lynch_a001.pdf
SPRUCE APHID 319
...and in the Mogollon Mountains and Sacramento Mountains of New Mexico (U.S. Forcst Service 1997, 2001; Lynch 2004). Spruce aphid was first found in the Pinalefo Mountains near Tigli Peak in early winter 1999 by staff with the University of Arizona's Mt.Graham Red Squirrel Monitoring Program (MGRSMP). The Majority of the Engelmann spruce on the mountain was severely defoliated by spring 2000. In the White Mountains, severe defoliation resulted in 24-41 percent mortality of Engelmann spruce (Lynch 2004). The extent and severity of spruce aphid claniage in such a short period in the Pinaleño Mountains raised concerns about the insect's potential effects on Mt.Graham red squirrel habitat. Additionally, the timing of defoliation raised questions about the seasonal history of this insect in high-elevation southwestern ecosystems. Previous damaging outbreaks of this insect have been in maritime environments in the spring and early summer, with only infrequent and mild population increases being recorded in the autumn (Carter and Halldórsson 1998). Almost complete defoliation of many Engelniann spruce stands, and the nearly undetectable levels of aphid populations by April, indicated that the epizootic event occurred prior to spring in the Pinaleño Mountains. Extensive European literature (see Day et al. 1998) describes spruce aphid maritime populations as increasing on dormant spruce in late winter through late spring, with occasional modest increases in the autumn. The aphids suck sap from host needle phloem cells, attacking the most recently produced needles after the foliage matures and hardens. Needles die and fall from the tree.
06/16/2016, Spruce: While useful to compare, I do not think this one Landsat image does much to decisively corroborate what the MODIS data is picking up, though it does show that the forests are not particularly vibrant and pristine. I think this may be some sort of multiyear progression. To help establish or refute this possibility, the patterns of apparent disturbance on the MODIS products need to be compared to multiyear data from the alternative data source (e.g., Landsat). It would help to show current (disturbed) versus historic (non-disturbed or less disturbed) Landsat data so one could visually assess the degradation or change in appearance of forest from one date to another.
In addition to this particular anomaly, I think the other areas I pointed to in NM are known to have a multiyear progression of western spruce budworm. I just went north to south along the main Rocky Mountain backbone. The ForWarn products are picking up the WSBW disturbance impacts along this location in my opinion.
06/14/2016, Norman: Here’s a high elevation anomaly that I don’t see on Joe’s list for the west that might be worth watching over the next week or two:  Mt Baldy Wilderness, Apache County Arizona, Apache National Forest. At this elevation, it’s foremost important this time of year to know if spring greenup might be a factor, and based on the multigraph, it seems that may be a factor.  As there is moderate drought, this cannot be “lingering snowpack”, though drought-suppressed greenup remains a possibility (i.e., much as we likely see in S Calif.)
According to ADS 2015, similarly structured anomalies are dubbed “spruce aphids” but in 2014 as “fir engravers” and in 2013 as “western spruce budworms” and in 2012 “Abiotic-frost” and then in 2011 as “spruce aphids” once again. Chances are that this year, we’re talking about one or more of these agents. However, they’re also in moderate drought (but zooming into the aerial photo, we’re talking about dense conifer forests as well as open grassy areas that are shown in red, so that’s not consistent with expectations of drought sensitivity).
This could be a nice example of how change detection does not unambiguously distinguish agents unless agents differ in their onset timing and habitat niche. It would be nice to know how accurate/complete these attributions are and if we’re seeing drought here.   This also reveals the problem of using a 3 or 5 or all year baselines, as we’ve got multiple agents and cumulative effects that may be contributing to slow declines.
The 2015 early 6 wk Duration areas agree only about half with the current 1 yr anomaly, but the 6/9/2015 1 year product was all over the place by comparison to the present, so I don’t know WHEN said disturbances are supposed to materialize in this part of the Universe.  As there is likely still a spring effect here, its worth adding to the watch list and vetting how disturbances were shown in ForWarn in prior years.

05/23/2016, Norman: From past weeks, as expected, this band is starting to dissipate using both the 1 year and mean baselines. I’ve decided in my mind that yes, this is a drought signal, but not a drought mortality signal. Instead what we see is a drought-induced delay in spring greenup; hence the elevation banding. It is problematic that we are failing to unambiguously see the drought and beelte mortality expressed here consistently with the 2015 ADS mapped efforts.  For reasons that make no sense to me, ForWarn has a problem with partial tree mortality in California. That shortcoming does not extend to fires or fuels treatment which removes both over and understory and typically has larger mortality patch sizes.  Let’s hope that the areas currently in red are long-persistent, but I fear this whole elevational anomaly is about to disappear.
06/01/2016, Norman: We can now compare the IDS for 2015 with ForWarn’s persistent banded anomaly in S California that has lingered through the entire month of May.  This is the normal time of year when there’s a slight rise in greenup that is detectable even with this strongly evergreen vegetation type, but as shown by the multigraph, winters typically never drop NDVI much because we’re below snowline (unlike higher elevations). The hard hit epicenters along this elevation band are now  20% below their means, and that is the most I can see having ever occurred at this time of year from the MODIS time series; though there are some springs when it was 10-15%. Given that this is in areas of dense conifer, the departure we’re seeing here has to be past mortality, not drought sensitive grass. What we see today can also include current stress to surviving trees, presaging further mortality in 2016.
We know that there was massive mortality here last year. Note that in 2015 IDS they dub this both Western Pine beetle mortality and fir engraver within this band. Note that the polygons from this single year overlap with different causes suggesting different flights too. Note that ForWarn shows current magnitude reductions that fall outside 2015 mapped polygons. Note that ADS polygons, especially those that are large and general shaped include areas that are not shown as departed compared to the long-term mean seasonal expectation (MMAX).
http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav2?theme=MODIS_Forest_Change_Product...
As stated in prior emails, the apparent reason for bandedness has to relate to elevation and the climatic and vegetation gradients that flow from that. That gradient causes variation in hosts for beetles as well as tree vulnerability factors, which are complex. Our GAP veg map (and mask) shows this runs at the lower bounds of the mixed conifer forest type and the upper bounds is best associated with normal snow line based on the multigraph irregularities. A map of cross year standard deviation of winter (i.e., Jan Feb) values would reveal this snow pack upper limit best, but we don’t have one up. The elevations affected lie mostly between 5000 and 7000 feet.
The key concern and justification for an alert here lies in the duration of this banded anomaly and the vulnerability of this vegetation at the lower limit of the type. While becoming less markedly elevational in recent weeks There are persistent epicenters within this banded anomaly that go back to late summer of last year—when these areas were mapped as having died. As the drought continues, we’re likely seeing a combination of dead trees and currently stressed trees from both insects (legacy effects to still living trees if its too early for 2016 beetle damage) and direct drought stress compounded from last year (and before that) through this past dry winter.
ForWarn’s magnitude (percent change) products provide severity insights that are not provided by the 2015 polygons and suggest where they might target new flights for documenting further declines. ForWarn’s ability to show cumulative/compounded effects from a long-ago baseline is particularly useful. This area is predicted to be in severe drought all year once again, so even if we’re seeing mostly 2015 mortality, the need for an alert remains.

","Monday, May 23, 2016","Weather","05/25/2016, Norman: This is remarkable here, as worsening from last week.  There’s no evidence of fire or fuels treatment Rx, and the extent is pretty broad and its patchy. There has been Gypsy Moth here before (see pre- 2011 IDS), but it seems a bit early to detect it starting May 7th, yes?  Those polygons are in these exact same spots on the southerly aspects as the current departure. Also, in the PestProx, I don’t see good candidates. Where was the GM last year? We don’t have that up yet to be able to tell.    So now looking at the severe 2007 defoliation here in the Archive, the GM defoliation on these ridgelines didn’t start until 6/17, peaking around 7/27 or so. That makes us either very early with GM this year, or we’ve got something else entirely.  In 2008, the All Yr Mean anomaly shows up on 6/8.  While we’re early, the Cloud product suggests brown, not white. This is probably worth notifying on ASAP if not clouds.  Peters Mountain NF Wilderness, Jefferson National Forest.  Given how early it is, my inference is that it’s a SW to NE-moving hail storm, not Gypsy Moth; except for the lack of similar directionality, I’d think it was the same event as in WV (above), just 40 km to the west.

"988","Premature leaf drop in swamps of SE LA","extensive apparent defoliation on the current MODIS 1 year change product
","Wednesday, September 2, 2015","Flooding","09/08/15, Brent Cutrer, LA DOF:  That area has been guarded against heavy flooding for decades and then the opening of the locks put them under several feet of water for months.  Definitely stressed them out.  I would say the understory more than the canopy due to the healthy canopy viewed when flying over the area.
09/08/15, Norman:  I like your explanation, but I’m still a bit confused. One lingering question is if trees are stressed by flooding, or if it is just a “water-over-understory” impact which we often see in areas that are flooded where NDVI drops when that low-height fraction of the detectable vegetation gets covered up (as may also happen with patchy snow in areas with evergreen understories)?
If water levels have been historically low, tree species may have acclimated, and now be seasonally stressed. Do some tree species (gum/oak?) senesce or suffer with rising summer water levels, or is it not likely to be consequential beyond the understory?
09/08/15, Brent Cutrer, LA DOF:  We have been looking into these signatures for a while now and I am pretty confident as of the cause.  This is the result of the flooding that occurred in 2013, when the Morganza Spillway locks were opened to relieve the Mississippi River, and was rerouted into the Atchafalaya River Basin.  It is obvious on the St. Martin and Iberville Parish signatures as the levee divides the departures from normal.  Also, there is a small area south of Baton Rouge, Manchac Point, that is showing a strong signature that received heavy flooding.  The lengthy flooding that occurred, during the growing season, happened from April to mid-summer and is now showing signs and I’m sure it will continue for several years.  I will continue to watch the other signatures further east and south, but I would also lean towards flooding.

09/01/15, Spruce: I recall from talking with a coastal ecologist from Southeastern University, Dr. Gary Shaffer, that the hydrologic modification can be a contributing factor in terms of spring time swamp forest defoliation by insects.   He indicated to me once that the tupelo swamps can lose their leaves in times of drought and then will grow them back once the drought lifts.
It seems like longer durations of swamp forest defoliation across the growing season – can have a negative impact on the health of the trees – especially given how often these areas are defoliated in the spring by insects. Many of the forests in the Atchafalaya are perennially flooded due to the levees.  This makes it more difficult for these trees/forests to regenerate.
I am not sure if there is late summer defoliating insects. I think there may be an entomologist at LSU that could weigh in on this.
09/01/15, Norman: I see it’s been Drought Monitor “moderate” or “abnormally dry” since 7/28/15 (last month), but note that stream flow is normal (if that matters for the wetlands much at this time of year, given channelization).
Most of the wetland anomalies are in yellow (10%-12% decline), which for a robust forest that’s typically at about 0.8 NDVI this time of year means ~0.72-.70 which is very low compared to how it appears on 9/1 in past years on the time series. The normal fall decline isn’t this early, but it does start soon. So we may be at the very low end of the standard deviation for this time of year on those wetland forest sites.
Are there any late season defoliators in that system? Pestprox suggests FTC (spring), Baldcypress leafroller (spring) and Sawflies (unknown).
Regarding the likelihood of drought, note that LA area sugar cane harvesters are quite concerned about drought—so it is making more difference in yield/effects than is suggested by USDM class “abnormally dry”. http://theadvocate.com/news/acadiana/13296738-123/sugar-farmers-hoping-f... .  Also note how hard it is in ForWarn to know current crop types, even in areas where there is predominantly cane here (the light purple is cane, also have rice and soy to the west). That is, are the extreme crop departures we show from crop rotation/fallow or from drought stress here?
http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav2?theme=MODIS_Forest_Change_Product...
Within the wetlands, compare phenoregions 50 to the current anomalies using the wetland type filter. That gives a general sense of congruency, but not perfect—that is, not confined to a single wetland veg type, though somewhat consistent too:
http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav2?theme=MODIS_Forest_Change_Product...
Early leaf fall from August drought seems most probable.
09/01/15, Spruce: I have been noticing NDVI decline in the swamps of SE LA for a few weeks now, showing up prominently even on the 1 year change product.  I checked it versus Landsat data for this versus last year at the same time of year and sure enough many of these forests are in defoliated state (see attached), perhaps due to prolonged heat and dry conditions.  Maybe though, other factors are at work???
I think this info could be of use of to the State of Louisiana.   The timing of the leaf drop varies, though it seems to be earlier this year than usual, even for the swamp and water tupelos.

08/31/15, Hargrove: Drought monitor is yellow here currently.  PestProx lists a lot of possibilities, maybe we just have to ask about attribution in this case ...
08/31/15, Norman:  I note this is essentially confined to the wetlands—part of the Green Bay State Wildlife area apparently to the SW and Green Bay Shores State Wildlife Area in the east. This area affected is large; on the order of 10-11 mi^2!  That’s not possible to be a late growing season Rx fire for wildlife.
Gypsy Moth hit hard in 2010, but over a much smaller area (13km away). This is called northern hardwoods which, combined with the USGS wetland condition up here implies that it could be spruce budworm or larch beetle rather than Gypsy Moth as fewer oaks should be present in the “conifer-hardwood swamp” as LANDFIRE eVeg types it.  My guess is the dominant hardwood here is red maple mixed in with FACW mesophytics.
The only other hypothetical explanation I see is drought, as it has been “abnormally dry” since about March continuously and drying wetlands could stress trees—again, this anomaly agrees pretty well with the wetland/bottomland topographic position, and arguments related to the extent of impacts, but importantly, not all wetland areas show anomalies (suggesting it could be insects). Moreover, the Peshtigo stream flow gauge to the NE of this area is currently green (normal).

08/31/15, Spruce:  There a couple of wetland forest areas in vicinity of Green Bay, Wisconsin that have apparent defoliation on the ForWarn products.

","Monday, August 24, 2015","Insects","08/17/15, JS:  FYI - below are some 2015 news articles regarding current growing season defoliation by eastern/western spruce budworm (mostly) and Douglas Fir Tussock moth (for CO). Also attached are 2 CO ADS reports for the 2015 survey that I pulled off a CO Tree Farmer's web site.  I think one of these is the same that Nancy forwarded to me earlier. There seems to be a couple of other 2015 CO ADS reports by Bill Ciesla that were not posted...I converted what was posted from pdf to docx.
In addition to posts on WSBW in ID and CO, eastern spruce budworm is now considered to be in outbreak mode in MI in the UP. I haven't had a chance to look in MI for this, but have looked in eastern ID and CO. I think it is showing up in ID on the multiyear change products (e.g., 5 year). To me, certain multiyear ForWarn forest change products are picking up the western budworm defoliation. Based on the ADS, many of these areas have been subjected to variable amounts of budworm defoliation for the past several years (e.g., 5 years) with the intensity depending on the year (some literature indicates that there can be more western spruce budworm defoliation during drought years when in outbreak mode - e.g., http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112714001960).  To help corroborate what can be gleaned from the ForWarn multiyear MODIS change products, I do think single date of Landsat data will be of limited use given the multiyear nature of the SBW defoliation. It will take current versus before Landsat data as a minimum and ForWarn like change products from multi-date Landsat to be more optimal.
08/14/15, Norman:  Yes. This area west of Yellowstone in particular seems likely to be Western Spruce Budworm based on ADS of the last 3 years and no fire.  There are scattered areas of departure across areas to the NE and E that are sometimes small. Is this the time of year this starts to show up? That is, are these light/sparse areas of departure the early signs?  Early Detect suggest that it could be about to get worse.
08/14/15, JS:  I checked the ForWarn products in relation to the news report and found that there is what I think is relevant NDVI decline in the area of concern (Eastern Idaho)  in locations where Douglas Fir and Subalpine Fir occurs.
For the 5 year and all year change products, there has been a gradual uptick in mild NDVI decline (averaging ~-3 to -5% on most recent date of ForWarn MODIS change products) on the coniferous forests adjacent to the range habitats. These are forests that can have a lot of Rocky Mountain Douglas Fir. Comparing to the ADS maps for the past 5 years, these areas have been mapped off and on as being WSBW impacted.  There a couple of locations with more severe NDVI drops. Comparison to the GAP/Landfire map indicate a mixture of Douglas Fir, Lodepole Pine, and Spruce-Fir forests.

","Friday, July 31, 2015","Insects","7/30/2015, Norman:  If the Doug Fir defoliation is substantial, it should certainly show up west of Boulder. The problem is knowing exactly where the Doug fir is. Isolating the DF niche within the Gap2001 Mixed conifer type west of Boulder suggests that the Doug fir is predominantly on the north aspects on the east flowing canyons. Do we see anomalies there? BC is right that we don’t have the cross-period persistence that we’d like, but I think there is a spotty and low severity anomaly outside the 2010 Fourmile Canyon Fire using the 5 year product that I would infer could be DFTM based on veg type and topographic position.
As expected, impacts are lower than what we’ve seen from insects elsewhere because in a mixed conifer forest, only a portion of the canopy species is affected. It’s been a decade since I walked through these stands, and note from 2009-10 ADS that Mtn Pine Beetle came through here hard at that time in the same areas we now see linear anomalies so if there was overstory pine/understory DF, (1) the long-term baselines would be hazardous to use and (2) if this is DFTM going after the DF now, that be a double whammy for these stands.  Note the linearity of many of these anomalies that often, but not always, correspond to the mx con types and streams.  This pattern may be shown to emerge and /or be magnified in the current 1 year Early Detect, but I’d prefer to  hold off before arguing that too loudly.  The bottom line for me is that given the veg type map, the defoliation patterns we expect to see are not giant blotches here, but more linear anomalies that correspond to the host; and I think we have evidence for that.  We’ll learn a lot from the flights.
7/29/2015, Norman:  This is emerging more each period and stronger on the Early Detect. Note that it is higher than the normal mapped ADS polygons which at highest elevation are western spruce budworms. These areas in orange and red include rather dense forests, mapped as lodgepole pine, ponderosa pine, mixed conifer at 9000 feet.  The NDVI profiles vary a lot among  years for reasons that aren’t clear—it might be climate-driven shifts in seasonality rather than insects.

","Friday, July 31, 2015","Drought","7/29/2015, Norman:  Note this peculiarly well-defined and rapidly developing drought anomaly over last 5-6 periods in San Saba County, TX, 6/25 to 7/27, 2015. This anomaly is emerging across 1,3,5 and all year products and is far worse on the 1 year standard to 1 year early detect, demonstrating its seasonal development in both “forest” and “shrub” layers—these are woodlands with grass, so we can expect drought sensitivity here unlike in dense conifer types that are inherently less responsive. According to 2015 hotspots, this area burned Jan, Mar in small fires 2015; but the anomaly is recent (summer), not continuous, as would be expected with fire effects.  It aligns well with the Current Drought Monitor, which suggests cause to me. The NDVI of these sites is highly variable for July due to differences in productivity, making anomalies during 1 or more periods in summer all-but-expected; however, this is unusually persistent. As the USDM integrates station data, that product is useful for diagnosing this large scale phenomenon. I bring this up to the group’s attention, because the drought response here, despite early year fire (that is unrelated), is particularly instructive.

"977","Historical Gypsy Moths in NE Pa 2014 and 2008","","Friday, July 31, 2015","Insects","7/31/2015, Norman:  Take a look at historical GM outbreaks in NE Pa and northern NJ for 2008 and 2014. Now that we have change products back through 2008 (thanks, Joe), we can easily compare ForWarn’s July’s progressive changes with ADS.
This may be the best comparative example I’ve seen yet that illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of these two approaches. In both years, ADS has arguably overmapped, undermapped and lacks insights about relative severity that are so readily conveyed by ForWarn and, arguably, rather important, ecologically; particularly when we’re talking about defoliation regime impacts instead of just event impacts.
A big challenge is knowing for sure what causes these anomalies in ForWarn when ADS missed them. Maybe they aren’t actually GM. Based on behavior, most of this has to be GM, though; at least in the areas of extended (i.e., 2-4 week persistence).  Note that the severity and duration of most unmapped areas with anomalies are generally equal to those areas that were mapped. Also revealing with this example is the variable mapping effort that is reflected by polygon size and the break at the state border in 2008. It appears that this large polygons includes areas that were severely defoliated, and much forest that was lightly affected, at most, based on ForWarn’s change insights.
Ecologically, the migrating defoliation of Gypsy Moth across years will never cease to impress me. It’s been recognized from flight mapping data at least since the 1970s, and now we have benefit of seeing this phenomenon mapped more accurately, it seems, with sub-annual resolution and most importantly, in full color (i.e., with gradients of severity).

"975","Eastern Nevada","","Tuesday, July 21, 2015","Unknown","07/20/15, Norman: Some more thoughts here. I think this is a good discussion, as it relates to interpretation/notification issues we’re going to need to revisit over and over again, given how common both drought and insects are becoming.
At per your suggestion, I’ve explored some more areas of the Humboldt NF. I think my interpretation is not as reliant on the GAP veg map as it is to past ADS occurrence here, elevation bands, and pine stand density as indicated by the aerial imagery.   I don’t question that pinyon defoliation is occurring, just that ForWarn seems to be ambiguous given expectations that drought will have a similar directional effect on departure as defoliation given the open and fragmented woodland stand attributes. However, I think we can agree that the Humboldt NF would probably be interested in both defoliation AND impacts from drought.
Based on ADS, we’d expect pinyon defoliation just about every year and that it be topographically and vegetatively where it has been reported from past years, more or less.  Note in the maps below that there are vast portions of the GAP dark brown (pinyon type) that don’t show much in ADS, but that ForWarn shows them as departed today. (Fire polygons are also shown). Those areas at higher elevations (i.e., in the interiors) are also departed for us, but defoliation is normally only at the lower, warmer elevations.  (One ecological inference is that lower elevation pine forests have long been at greater drought stress than those higher up, and that stress has contributed to the insect defoliation over recent years; so drought and insects are causally related within this type.   Our problem is that drought stress to the grass component may also be more severe at lower pine zone elevations, so we’re seeing both direct and direct drought impacts to this forest between ADS and ForWarn.  If true, that’s pretty exciting from a monitoring perspective.) I’m a bit concerned that there are some ranges that don’t have ADS at all, suggesting that some of the lack of historical polygons may be a No-Fly Artifact, but much of the departure we see at higher elevations just above historical polygons would seemingly have been mapped, if defoliation was the normal driver there.  If defoliation is moving upslope compared to past years, that would be quite significant, and we do see departure above where it has been mapped in the past (on the 2nd map below). The problem is that severe drought can be manifest across elevations too (by July), and the most sensitive open woodlands are common across elevations.
When the forest mask is removed, the extreme departure in shrubs and grass here suggest that the grass fraction within mixed pixels is also going to be departed from the 1 year normal by this time of year. The 3rd  image below shows masks removed and that dense pine forests show far less departure than woodlands, and certainly from non-woodland shrubs/grass. This relationship is admittedly imperfect, especially where there are complex elevation or species gradients—but it is generally true.  To see insects, the exceptions to the general pattern of “more grass = more drought departure” are what we need to look for (e.g., areas of more extreme departure greater than expected from drought, given stand density), as that should be the defoliator signal much like we saw in Texas in 2011 where  we saw fire departure superimposed on the drought signal. Dense forests with high departure are what I would call a clear defoliation. Unfortunately, ADS suggests that defoliation is also common in very open woodlands where drought is inevitably intertangled, and that is where our product could cause both Type I and Type II errors.
Regarding the “To Notify Or Not To Notify” question; based on past mal experiences when multiple drivers are at play, I’m concerned about how difficult it is to communicate multiple causes as we don’t want them to think that most of what we show necessarily is worth a special flight. Dialogue with them is key as are a few lines explaining limitations. We would gain knowing where they know they have defoliation  this year, they could gain by having our change products to help refine their insights; and if there are ranges that are completely undersurveyed, as there may be based on historical ADS, ForWarn might help there most. However, we don’t want ForWarn’s drought sensitive stands to become a red herring for them.  After seeing what comes out today, let’s let them know that we see departure from drought and possible insect defoliation in the pine belt, but include caveats about the especial tendency of open woodlands to show departure from drought. For any given site, it is a pretty easy task to zoom into the NAIP to see if the pixel has a lot of grass in it or not, and they can do that as easily as we can; and they would know best where they have the defoliation.  I still hold that the majority of what we see with our forest mask in non-fire areas is actually drought departure; but they may be just as interested in that as defoliation, although we may not be showing a measured tree response at all.
NLCD mask update----As you suggest, the datedness of the masks is worth revisiting. It fails us when we need a recent filter. My greatest frustration is that I often need an “ever-been forest” mask which is more like what we used to have. When a fire occurs in the west, the site often gets reclassified by NLCD as shrub, but to show the “state of the mountain” you don’t want to turn on all the shrub, as that toggles on the entire landscape even when some sectors have never been anything but shrub.  That was a problem with the Pandora example, as there are some recent fires there that are successional shrub rather than permanent shrub, and I wanted to show just the former with the remaining forest.  We don’t need masks to serve the same purpose as multiple baselines, but right now they do, but for an outdated year.
07/20/15, Spruce:  There is also a lot of PJW areas in the region of concern and also the drought impacted western US at large that do not have NDVI decline. So it is not a universal condition.  Look at the URL – same as in the original email but with the GAP/Landfire map underlain. Toggle change map off and on to see how much PJW occurs with NDVI gain as opposed to NDVI decline. There is a substantial amount of healthy PJW as a function of NDVI in this area of interest:
http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav2?theme=CONUS_Vegetation_Monitoring...
Reading over the literature, the relationship of insect damage to pinyon pine and drought can be intermingled/concurrent.  Just because there is an indication of drought on the Drought Monitor doesn’t mean that the whole area should be written off as a mere drought impact. The potential pests I mention did not include needlecast (fungus disease) as you mentioned, but instead are insect related (sawfly and scale insects) damage.
I partially agree with what you said about the short comings of the ForWarn forest mask in that the 2006 NLCD land cover maps ability to discriminate woodlands is far from perfect. However, to me, the use of the NLCD for the forest mask results in coniferous woodlands being grouped under scrub/shrub (with sage brush e.g.,) at least as much as it groups woodlands into the softwood forest category. This is not only a problem with PJW occurring across millions of acres but also ponderosa pine woodlands. The NLCD 2006 data is also getting old. I am not sure why the 2006 NLCD is being used, given that we have 2010 NLCD and the NLCD 2006 land cover map is almost 10 years old.
Anyways, in compiling lists of potential alert worthy disturbances, I was working under the notion that if there was a reason for understandable concern that an alert could be sent out.  Just because you discount an assessment for one reason or another, to me doesn’t mean consideration should be given to alert folks who might benefit from the resource monitoring information.  This could be an opportunity to get some feedback from ADS folks in NV and may lead to them using ForWarn products ('share' url's are not from the archive).
07/20/15, Norman: Pine uplands of Nevada;  possibly pinyon defoliation. While there could certainly be insect damage with some of this, zooming into the aerial, nearly all of this departure looks like a regional manifestation of the USDM’s Severe Drought condition, as registered by grass productivity that normally peaks in June-July compared to the normally flat dense forests here.  That results from the open stand conditions of this vegetation type.  I don’t trust the “meaning” of the forest mask here, as the dry conditions lead to open woodlands that may have as much grass as tree signature in a given pixel ('share' url's are not from the archive).

One remarkable exception to this probable drought impact over much of this region is here, where a large discrete ecotonal anomaly has been growing since this past winter, but with no evidence of fire this year or last.

While there could certainly be insect damage with some of this, zooming into the aerial, nearly all of this departure looks like a regional manifestation of the USDM’s Severe Drought condition, as registered by grass productivity that normally peaks in June-July compared to the normally flat dense forests here.  That results from the open stand conditions of this vegetation type.  I don’t trust the “meaning” of the forest mask here, as the dry conditions lead to open woodlands that may have as much grass as tree signature in a given pixel ('share' url's are not from the archive).

One remarkable exception to this probable drought impact over much of this region is here, where a large discrete ecotonal anomaly has been growing since this past winter, but with no evidence of fire this year or last. I’m not sure how needlecast manifests itself as a comparison of prior years’ ADS polygons with our maps and multigraph from this neighborhood isn’t particularly useful. This woodland seems particularly climate-sensitive in the multigraph. http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav2?theme=MODIS_Forest_Change_Product...

","Tuesday, July 7, 2015","Fire","07/07/15, SPN:  Actually, zooming in close with the 1 year change product, its clear that the heart of this is in the residual blocks of an area being clearcut, suggesting active logging in the last 12 months here. Note in the ForWarn Archive that this isn’t new, having occurred this winter—seemingly starting in mid December. Continued harvesting beyond the existing clearcut area shown on the NAIP is a possibility at 3000’ as this is outside Willamette National Forest, though I wouldn’t expect logging in December as that’s the wet season and there are erosion issues with that and often state limitations, though I don’t know Oregon’s seasonal harvesting rules.  Note the public-private border on the NAIP.
The only thing that gives me pause with logging is that a cut here would greatly increase the size of the clearcut above what is expected, but to counter that, they’re also created an anomaly to the north of this residual block by mid 2014, so it seems to be the plan: http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav2?theme=MODIS_Forest_Change_Product...
For me, the core anomaly is relatively recent active logging (last year), with a minor chance that it’s an escaped logging slash fire; then there is a muted expression in the previously logged areas, now grass/shrubs, that can be explained by the relatively high sensitivity of early successional species to the current “Severe Drought”.  I’m surprising they’re creating such large clearcuts here though, especially with this addition of a fire-prone south slope.
07/07/15, Christie: team email sent with Landsat 07/02/15 image and FW 06/26/15 1yr max comparison, suggests fire.
07/06/15, SPN: Unsure what this is, but note on the multigraph (but it’s not in the Fire datasets) that it may have burned/been logged/etc early in 2010.  Maybe some follow up treatment????

"946","California Drought (2015)","","Wednesday, July 1, 2015","Drought","02/29/15, Norman:  CA’s complex drought expression in grass: I’m continued to be impressed with how beautifully grass acts as an ephemeral indicator of drought. Once again, we see the ability of grass as a “drought indicator” to diminish in mid-summer, just as we saw in prior years.  What’s really intriguing is the pattern within the veg type that emerges through the season that could relate to different dominant grass species and their separate phenological behaviors, elevation (that’s clear), subtle recent or legacy weather impacts, or maybe even management like grazing or seasonal grazing legacies. Areas of mixed veg type (though all shown on the link below is majority grass) may also explain some of this normalizing patterning we’re seeing evolve in the southern Great Valley.  Expect this grass anomaly to be reduced even more next period as grass transitions to its normative summer brown. That is, droughty brown and annual brown are brown. Note the current reduction in anomaly is consistent across baselines, and that its presence on the one year is consistent with expectations of reduced spring productivity this year compared to 2014. This will be a remarkable highlight and should clarify ForWarn’s use as a science monitoring tool for rangeland monitors.

","Tuesday, June 23, 2015","Insects","06/25/15, Mike Hart, NJ State Forestry Services:  Yes, we have a gypsy moth defoliation going on in that area.
06/23/15, Spruce:  Here is recent Landsat data that corroborates the NDVI decline anomaly in Northern NJ and Southeast New York State.  It shows defoliation in the area of concern. It looks like defoliation is occurring in the same area as last year.  I think the NDVI decline may still be intensifying.  The Landsat image from 6-7-2015 is based on the NIR, SWIR-1, and Red bands loaded into RGB. One of the ForWarn forest change products uses the 5 year baseline and has an end date of 6-9-2015 and the other is also 5 year forest change but instead for 6-17-2015.  The latter shows some intensification of the defoliation compared to one date earlier.

","Monday, June 22, 2015","Insects","062415, Amanda Grady:  That is wonderful that ForWarn picked this up. The disturbance mapper is also picking this extreme defoliation event up.  It is indeed a pandora moth outbreak where many areas were completely defoliated 100%.  We have lots of complementary ground data on this too. We are always looking for better and more ways to detect forest damage/change in greenness.  We recently flew this via an early aerial survey to detect the damage when the aerial signature was most apparent (prior to needle elongation of the current years foliage).  We have been working with FHTET to conduct an operational remote sensing flight which occurred the same week as the aerial survey that I flew/mapped.  I am starting annual leave tomorrow but will get back to you when I get back, I have not used ForWarn much but look forward to using and comparing the data collected via several methods.
Thank you again for the message, talk with you soon.

06/21/15, Norman:  This is a great example not just as a ForWarn success story, but as a remarkable documentation of a really neat episodic phenomenon of nature! First note that this area is not in drought this year, nor was it in 2013 or 2014.
I note that Early Detect shows the defoliation is actively growing. Compared to 2013, it has shifted a few miles to the S and W and N and NW. We see this shifting defoliation phenomenon across hosts and species and when present is related to 1) reduction of the most vulnerable host individuals/species (typically only 1% of trees die http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/r3/forest-grasslandhealth/?cid=stelprdb522... ) or 2) parasites/pathogens that keep defoliator populations in check locally or 3) subtle differences in environmental conditions across years from place to place, or 4) chance.  The 2013 area shows up as above last-year blue, so leaves are recovering there.  These outbreaks can have severe impacts on growth: Bennett et al 1987: https://books.google.com/books?id=NCXFOd2Ty64C&lpg=PT1&ots=9oTKStviB5&dq...
I note that the 2013 defoliation we saw in ForWarn was primarily mapped by ADS (the epicenter was), but ForWarn also maps a sizable area as somewhat less defoliated immediately adjacent and to the NW of the pink area below (not shown). Also note that this 2013 moderately affected area does not show up on the current defoliation on the 1 year, but it does a bit on those of the longer term. That may mean something. Toggle the 1 year to compare the 2013 event: http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav2?theme=MODIS_Forest_Change_Product...
Zooming into the aerial for this affected area, the ponderosa pine comprise a nice open forest that I’d consider relatively desirable from a restoration/fire resilience perspective. The image below is for 2013’s outbreak. Note the effect of these on the NDVI time series.  The moderately defoliated area that ADS does not map is hard to see on the time series, so it may have escaped aerial detection.

http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav2?theme=MODIS_Forest_Change_Product...
06/21/15, Spruce:  I reviewed ForWarn products for the Kaibab NF Jacob's Lake area in Northern AZ where Pandora moth defoliation of Ponderosa pine forests occurred in 2013.
There is apparent defoliation that is occurring slightly west of where it occurred in 2013.  The NDVI decline anomaly has occurred in the last 2 dates of ForWarn products.  It is also apparent in the Early Detect change product which when cloud free can show what the MVC NDVI previous year change product will look like in the following week.
I haven't had a chance to look at the Landsat data for this, though feel that this is likely to be real defoliation.  The MODIS true color for the two most current dates of ForWarn products look good.
The RSAC/FHTET product doesn't show the anomaly, but it did not show the anomaly for 2013 in the same location.  The 2013 anomaly was reported and confirmed by USFS entomologist Ryan Hanavan.
In comparing the 2015 to the 2013 NDVI decline for ForWarn product dates ending in 6/17, it seems like the progression of apparent defoliation in 2015 is somewhat ahead of what was seen in 2013.  It seems already more defoliated in the 2015 products (has been for last 2 dates) whereas the defoliation was still ramping up in the 6/17/13 product.
The 2015 apparent defoliation can be viewed on these ForWarn products:

","Monday, June 22, 2015","Unknown","07/01/15, Norman:  As per my assessment Monday, I feel I know what this is and I don’t think its disturbance. As the phenological period is still around 80L, and multigraph shows normally NDVI-variable this time of year, I think it’s simply different vegetational and topographic phenological manifestations of a late and wet spring. It is not yet summer here plus this is a naturally volatile landscape.
Ranking of reasons for thinking that it is seasonal climate rather than disturbance:
(1)	The extent is so broad but within these counties and there’s a similar area hundreds of miles to the NW in similar wetlands: See here: http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav2?theme=MODIS_Forest_Change_Product...
(2)	General anomaly is confined to one topographic niche (bogs/wetlands—see mask) that is more precipitation sensitive, and it’s been a wet spring https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/national/201505..  We’re not talking open water (ponds) here, but bogs that are always likely vegetated with sedges, shrubs, sphagnum, and scattered trees (like larch), so there is vegetation but it varies year to year as to how robust it is and how it develops temporally.
(3)	While specific anomaly patches have texture, this could just as easily be differences in hydrology or veg type as local management or local disturbance from insects/disease/fire, so that is not clear evidence for disturbance.
(4)	There is no ADS candidate this time of year, as larch casebearer comes out later in the season, not now like FTC would, and that is too localized. FTC is a big problem here though—look at the early ADS years, but its confined to the uplands, not the wetlands (unless they just didn’t bother to map it here). What is the FTC host in bogs? There may be some, but I’d think the outbreak would also be manifest in the uplands where it normally is mapped, right? FTC is a major defoliator of aspen and “hardwoods” according to these early ADS years (below), and there isn’t the black cherry here that we see in the northern Apps, so I’m not sure what else they might go after. Similarly, Rx fire is unlikely, given the extent of this, and there are no hotspots associated with these anomalies Even though that doesn’t mean they didn’t burn it, of course, but I’d think there’d be some at least—they don’t burn all wetlands at once and not at this time of year, I’d surmise (too late).  So for want of a suitable local explanation, I’m left with the most parsimonious explanation which is climate, Since it is still spring (near 80L), and an anomalously wet spring at that, and because these are the wettest sites in the landscape, it is likely to be tied to that.
(5)	Finally note the extreme normal variability in these systems from year to year on the multigraph. That means we should expect anomalies in this system at this time of year through summer, just as we are seeing here.  If anything, I’m confused by why we don’t see anomalies every year!  Note on the second map below (the standard deviation of growing season conditions) that this is not a stable place here.
I don’t expect them to be able to explain this with fieldwork or aerial surveys.

(pic)
06/29/15, Norman:  I too noted that MN anomaly was still there and it puzzles me. I think this is the same one that I suggested a week ago could have been an Rx fire, but it is persisting, so maybe it’s a defoliation of some sort. It may have been a cool spring there and we still may be seeing slow greening there. If I recall it was public land either state or federal.   In what month does spruce budworm defoliate in northern MN?
06/29/15, Spruce:  MN – NDVI decline anomaly – damage agents unknown – in multiple types of boreal wetland forest – It also could be due to multiple damage agents – possibly larch case bearer and spruce budworm.
06/21/15, Norman:  This peatland anomaly has been growing and shows up as brown on the true color—this vegetation type shows up on the ESRI aerial pretty closely corresponding to the anomaly: Though there are no hotspots, my guess is that it burned this spring……however note that it is not Federal land, but the topo suggests State Wildlife area, which supports the Rx fire argument: I just wish there were some hotspots though.

This is particularly remarkable because it isn’t being mapped as particularly anomalous by the USDM now or over recent years, yet it’s beet red!  This anomaly started in late April and has been growing steadily ever since. It seems to me that it has nothing to do with drought, clouds or an invasion of megafauna or fire. So it could be explained by grasses’ peculiar phenology and how it’s responding to winter-spring climate conditions this year relative to the past. Start of Greenup is normally early to Mid April here, with the peak around the beginning of July. It could be that greenup is late or its just setting up to be an unproductive year due to the unusual spring warmth there in the SE corner of the state. Note that it may be part of a broader phenomenon that extends into central SD northwestern NE and NE CO too—all areas that are pretty much outside the USDM affected areas!

"937","East Texas Flooding","Declines in NDVI due to rains and flooding; Cropland discussion
","Thursday, June 11, 2015","Flooding","06/15/15, Norman (croplands):
As we saw from our ability to map mid season hail damage in past years in the Great Plains, http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/highlights/141 for example, ForWarn’s technology could have real applications for refining county-resolution disaster aid and even crop futures; but just as with forests and grasslands, there is a need for translating NDVI change to actual impacts, particularly where crops are in rotation with radical year to year (and therefore period to baseline) changes in NDVI. Our products should appeal to those who specialize in doing just this.
I once bookmarked a NRT NDVI crop viewer that allowed  users to graph NDVI history and NRT values at once. It may have been using AVHRR, and I seem to have remembered the ability to get summary data from drawing a box of my choosing on the website, although I can’t locate the URL now.  Does anyone remember this NRT viewer?
I note USDA FAS’s Crop Explorer group could be interested in our information, as they mostly use AVHRR now http://www.pecad.fas.usda.gov/cropexplorer/.  Note that like RSAC, they also have a MODIS data viewer for raw feed (of unprocessed cloud-contaminated images) that includes a WMS server for the images: http://www.pecad.fas.usda.gov/cropexplorer/modis_summary/modis_page.aspx.... They seem to be acting as a venue for remote sensors to grab imagery to do their own processing, much of which I think we’ve already done for them, so if we could work with them, they might add our product line and we could call them a partner.  Note that in their product delivery, they show small maps of AVHRR for the last 10 day period and then a baseline which is the “short-term-average” which they don’t define, but is the past week or two within the current year—the also have a prior 1 year year departure: http://www.pecad.fas.usda.gov/cropexplorer/imageview.aspx?regionid=us&st... . These are coarse resolution, plus very small maps, plus they have very limited baselines compared to ForWarn! With AVHRR, it’s harder to remove clouds, but it looks like they’re after the grand regional picture only, given the size of their products.  Note their cool automatic growing season animations. I wonder if we could get these generated automatically for the ForWarn website?
The best historical federal crop online GIS database is this: http://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/.  It uses the USDA NASS 30m National Crop Layers. We show the last two crop layers resampled to 232m on the FCAV under “Physiography” (although it’s hard for a USDA visitor to find them given our Forest-centric structure), and it’s unclear why they would want to use a resampled product at 64x less resolution that they have available otherwise on Cropscape except that Cropscape doesn’t show NRT disturbance or variation in the onset or growth of crops.  I do note they have annual updates on crop type frequency that we could add to the viewer: http://www.nass.usda.gov/research/Cropland/Release/. If “the cloud” can handle it, it might be nice to retain the 30m resolution on some of these products.
I wish I could find that other source; but what is interesting is that of these two major Ag products, one is way too coarse to be useful for disturbance detection, and the other is fine res, but annual. ForWarn could provide a high quality middle product that could be used to integrate both while providing insight that goes beyond drought/weather disturbance.
06/15/15, Spruce (croplands):
I checked the more upland non-forested NDVI decline areas in the east Texas region using early June Landsat data and these are predominantly bare soil agricultural fields.  These areas are spread out over multiple Landsat scenes (I pulled 3 and impacts are evident on areas covered by at least a couple more. My theory is that all the rains hitting this region in May raised havoc with planting of crops. I saw some video footage on the weather channel for this region that showed that some of these areas were so water soaked that they appeared to be floating on water underneath – when a person walked over the land.
A recent NASS report for Texas confirms delayed planting due to the rains. See http://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/Texas/Publications/Crop_Pro....
The NDVI decline in these bare agricultural fields could be due to a combination of being water logged and having delayed green-up associated with planting delays.
I think that ForWarn may be one of the only products out there that records these kinds of agricultural disturbance impacts region wide. Perhaps NASS or FSA (crop insurance or disaster loans) would be interested in assessing the event using ForWarn products???
Regarding TX FSA, see http://www.fsa.usda.gov/FSA/newsReleases?mystate=tx&area=stnewsroom&subj....
06/11/15, Norman:
More than the expected flood damage in northeastern Texas’ bottomlands, I’m struck by the extensive anomalies in the grasslands around Dallas. The landscape shows up as anomalous on the 1 year for the last 2 products along with all max baselines and even the 2000-14 mean. This has been a very wet spring across Texas, and at first blush, negative grass departure is completely unexpected! Note that this reduction is also evident in the ag areas.  It sneaks onto the Forest mask here too, but that’s expected with our approach to using majority type for masks. On that layer, it makes it harder to see the flood damage of the riparian areas apart from this upland phenomenon.
I’ll argue that this anomaly is not grass or crop damage from storms, as it is showing up on the 1 year during a wetter than prior year spring and rain is not likely to damage upland grass the way scour and burial occurs on floodplains. Neither can this anomaly relate to the 2011-12 drought as grass would be recovering strongly between 2014 and 2015.  Instead, I think this results from the narrow grass phenological pulse and an earlier-than-prior-year peak in grass phenology.
It’s not about how productive the vegetation is this year versus past years, but when the pulse occurs that causes this upland grass anomaly.  Note that departure is absent in prior weeks and months after a strong, early greenup, however, based on history of grass duration as shown on the multigraph, it is now likely past its peak. Stretch out the multigraph for prior years to see how the system normally behaves. You can also see the greenup transition among Cloud Detection products over recent months—this grassland was well greened up by early April. http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav2?theme=MODIS_Forest_Change_Product...
Median Start of Greenup is March: http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav2?theme=MODIS_Phenology_Parameters_...
We see this same phenomenon, an “anomaly from asynchrony”, across the eastern forests with a late or early spring/fall, but here, the phenological hump occurs over a much shorter period of time due to the peculiar life strategy of grass. This is a potential concern when interpreting drought effects in the West using grass as a drought indicator too, as grassy peaks can be as narrow as a few ForWarn periods and the timing of pulses can vary quite a bit among years.
06/11/15, Spruce:
There are severe NDVI declines (e.g., -20% or worse) along the riverine flood plains of eastern TX and adjacent states (AR, OK, northern LA) with respect to the Red River. It also includes portions of the Trinity and Brazo Rivers, plus certain more upland areas encompassing the Dallas metro region.

Latest Mean of Max – all years change – all lands:http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav2?theme=CONUS_Vegetation_Monitoring... – This gives a more conservative view but still shows extensive NDVI decline in known flood impacted areas.

06/21/15, Norman:  as predicted, this anomaly has disappeared by this period consistent with behavior in past years. What my final interpretation of this is that the hills are mesophytic glacial till (with clay) and the bottoms mostly sandy outwash that supported oak with some pine. In early spring greenup here, the cold conditions forced a delay in the more cold-sensitive species (oaks) on more cold-microclimatic sites (oaks), while the mesophytics went relatively affected by this late cool spring;
http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav2?theme=MODIS_Forest_Change_Product...
06/04/2015, J. Spruce: The anomaly shows yellow to red on the ForWarn 5 year change product and is in brown tones on the MODIS true color. The latter is of excellent quality. I can see the anomaly also on Landsat data acquired this year during the same 24 day window.  The anomaly occurs in a mix of northern hardwoods and oak/pine forest, according to the GAP/Landfire landcover map. The ForWarn ""all year phenotype max"" vegetation change product also shows the anomaly equally well as the 5 year change product.
RSAC-FHTET 3 year change product doesn't show this assemblage of anomalies at all and doesn't correspond to the MODIS true color or the Landsat data.
In contrast, the ForWarn 3 year change product does show this set of anomalies almost as well as the 5 year change product.
Unfortunately, like with most disturbances this year, ForWarn's 1 year change product does not pick up these anomalies hardly at all and this is the default change product.
The ForWarn change product using all previous years change shows the anomalies most prominently, but practically at the same level as the 5 year change and the phenotype max change product.  This product is very clean for this location and date, though can be either very busy and/or else noisy.
For detecting forest defoliation in the eastern US, I think it may be better to use the 3 or 5 year change product as the default, as opposed to retaining the 1 year change as the default.

Maybe they were very low intensity maintenance fires or too early in the year to make a difference in NDVI. My guess is both are explanations for those non-detections.
But as you point out Joe; and particularly on private lands, there are a lot of off-blue haze clusters that exhibit core areas of stronger anomaly: that makes me think there could be some type of defoliator at work here. Note that in 2013 there were loopers according to IDS--mapped with rough polygons but in this same general area. I can find no broad-scale anomaly associated with them in ForWarn for spring/early summer 2013 though these might be more of a late summer phenomenon as shown by this one anomaly within the large 2013 looper polygon just west of the Iron Co line. If this is a looper here, then what we are seeing is not looper based on shape, impact and timing. There are some apparent drought-associated losses in this landscape and likely several other insects and disease factors.

","Wednesday, May 20, 2015","Weather","05/19/2015, Norman:
Much like we’ve seen before, the late April storm cell that caused this wind-hail damage seems to have weakened, then restrengthened. The primary affected area is about 50 km long in Union County, but after a few minutes, it seems to have continued onto the ag land much further through Morehouse and Richland Parishes and the MS bottomland. It’s harder to see through this cropland because of annual crop changes (corn, rice, soy rotations). Differences in period productivity for these crop choices cause dark red and dark  blue anomalies, the latter of which will compensate for disturbance; but the linear yellow haze through this zone suggests the storm line continued nearly to Interstate 20 (note that Madison County, where it would intersect with I20) is not listed as eligible for disaster aid), and it seems to have ended by then, based on ForWarn. It is remarkable that we can see though all this much greater crop type change to still see this storm track, I think.
From the news account, the LA Parishes that are eligible to receive disaster aid are:
Union (primary)
Claiborne
Lincoln
Morehouse
Ouachita
But the LA Parishes affected by this event, according to ForWarn’s most recent 1 year product are:
Union (primary)
Morehouse
Richland
Ouachita (minor)
Note that Lincoln Par. is SSW of hard-hit Union, but that ForWarn shows no clear storm damage. The same is true for Claiborne Par., immediately to the west of hard hit Union Par.
http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav2?theme=MODIS_Forest_Change_Product...
Declarations of disasters suggests damage to crops is severe, and while effects could be small and scattered, we should be able to detect any such disaster. I’m surprised that we do see moderate impacts in Richland County and that it was not included on the list—perhaps because federal support is directed to cropland, not forest. In areas where crops are in rotation, it may be hard to detect crop damage with ForWarn’s approach to historical baselines, though there is no alternative without knowing what is being planted.  In areas of rotation, our assessment of damage seems to be based on impacts to surrounding vegetation as much as to the actual crop lands.  This crop flux has to be a challenge for farm aid assessments if they rely on remote sensing without special high resolution flights.
From NOAA: http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/150422_rpts.html under wind reports, note that 4 (miles?) west of Collinston in Morehouse Par. there was “substantial tree damage in the area from highway 165 and along and north of highway 554.” That puts it in the affected linear zone that we detect, though more severe damage is in the bottom lands south of Colleston (crops, according to imagery and NLCD):

In further studying this year's apparent swamp forest defoliation in coastal NC and SC, I started looking at the ALC 1 year change products for the last three dates.  You can see the progression of defoliation quite well - better I think than with the other change products in this particular case.
While it gives a more current look the MVC change and its an early spring in the area of interest,  the ALC change is versus the previous year so the background should be fairly green - which it is.
When I look at the MVC NDVI change products, aside from the 1 year change that doesn't show much, I see less defoliation apparent.  As one opens the aperture (increase the number of previous years of max NDVI), the background clutter increases but is not as predominant as it would be earlier in the growing season. The ALC I think is working better due to the rate at which the defoliation acceleration occurs. It is mostly if not all happening within a 24 day window, which may also partially encompass the area of interests green-up.
At any rate, I think the ALC NDVI change products gives the best look at the current apparent defoliation in the Carolina coastal swamps.  I haven't had time to check vs. Landsat, though it seems like this info would be of use to FH folks in NC and FC?

FYI – Checking out the latest date of ForWarn products, I found an NDVI decline anomaly for Mount Magazine SP in Arkansas (Logan County west of Booneville) that maybe related to storm damage. There is damage streak runs from SW to NE that is similar to hail streaks I have seen previously.
Enclosed below is the MUC forest change product for the current date (ending 5-8-2015) overlain on the true color RGB for the same date:http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav2?theme=CONUS_Vegetation_Monitoring...

I think this is this includes the highest point in Arkansas and is a heavily used recreation area.
The MODIS true color RGB for date ending 5-8-15 looks to be of excellent quality.
I think the anomaly could also be related to a late green-up, but its orientation doesn’t parallel the contours.  The orientation pattern makes it seem to me like it could be due to hail and/or storm damage

The feature is most apparent on the all year change product.  Maybe this is also 2011 drought related?  This anomaly is present more or less on the 3 most current dates of ForWarn products.  Based on some on-line documentation, the habitat/area of interest is noted as having periodic decline and wilt issues.
Norman 050415: My sense is given how open these oaky stands are, the extreme departure on the All Year Max product (4/30/2015) that is nearly absent from the All Year Mean product reflects an extremely wet and productive year during the MODIS history, and how that affected the understory as much as tree mortality (that we know from all reports has happened).
We really need to do some intensive analysis of this 2011 drought impact in east TX by comparing it in GIS with recent years of NAIP that show dead trees. By comparing patterns to different NDVI signatures and departure maps with observed change in the canopy, we might be able to derive a drought oak mortality signature from the climate noise better than we can right now. This more severe area (from the all year mean) doesn’t seem to be a fire.
Of the area you highlighted, I’m particularly drawn to this area of anomaly from the All Year Mean. On most multigraphs for these areas affected, the 2011 drought effect is detectable, but there are no extreme and obvious NDVI indicator of severe type conversion I looked at. We need to get 2014 up, as drought mortality can be delayed.

The MUC change to me is more cover type centric, given the phenoregion zonal NDVI baseline.  It also shows spots with more intense drops of NDVI.  These red spots may be of interest to the TX FS for checking on the ground.  It may be indicative of something new (e.g., oak wilt?) on top of whatever the 2011 drought did to the vegetation.

I base this also on what I also remember what these areas look like non-defoliated spring date of Landsat from another year.
The defoliation is showing up most realistically on forest change using the mean of max NDVI.  I think this is given that the defoliation is often an annual occurrence but also because there are differences in the timing of spring green-up.
Unfortunately, the other USFS/NASA ForWarn forest change products and the MODIS true color RGB are NOT getting refreshed properly on the FCAV.  We had the same problem last week with NEMAC having to fix after we alerted them of the problem.  The RSAC/FHTET product isn’t refreshed either. However, I checked the NEMAC SFTP site and they haven’t posted theirs yet – maybe something must have happened to their cloud computing enhanced throughput…The RSAC/FHTET products for last week only regarded 1 product, the one comparing current VI to that from the 3 year baseline. Maybe they discontinued the change product using the 5 year base line?

"913","SC Bottomland Hardwoods - winter","Is it too early for FTC in SC?
","Thursday, February 19, 2015","Flooding, Unknown","02/19/2015 SPN: I note that there were anomalies here in 2010, 2014 and 2015 in these bottomland wetlands. It seems way too early for FTC.  In 2010, the anomaly began by the beginning of January, and even this year it was evident in January. What's interesting is that it is not there in other years. So if January is not insects, and normal flow suggests it's not hydrological either presently (i.e., water over evergreen), what is it?  The multigraph in 2010 shows a dip that is similar to the mountains where we've attributed low Jan to snow-over evergreen, but in SC, we are pretty low and warm by comparison.
Clueing in on 2010, I'm going to speculate that this interannual variability is related to the sensitivity of semi-evergreen herbaceous plants to cold. In some winters semi-evergreen stays green more than in cold years/sites.  As this is a climate- and species-specific phenomenon, we can't expect to see it everywhere across years.  In the mountains, I think we've got this semi-evergreenness in the fall--that leads to the stepped decline in November-December that we've observed for years on forest time series in the mountains. This is an extension of that idea to warmer coastal plain environments where there is likely to be interannual differences in the photosynthetic activity of certain plants, or if not actual photosynthesis, at least their greenness is residual when it stays warm. To my knowledge, no one has ever demonstrated this across winters, but researchers have for forest herbs in the late fall to document that autumnal niche, but it seems reasonable to suggest that through-winter green retention is possible in environments, such as this during some years.
To test this, are these winters colder than the others? What's the HDD for December-January here?  LANDSAT should tell us if there is generic residual green some years and not others in January.
If resolvable, given the shadows and other winter complexities involved, this would be a particularly novel and exciting vegetational discovery, but it could explain some of the winter variability that we haven't been able to account for.  I wouldn't expect winter retention here in the mountains or north (even if snow could be removed) as its always too cold for semi-evergreen species, but I think it would be common in Florida and the warmer coastal plain where winter temperatures are variable.  Once cold-shocked, it should not recover until spring. I'm not sure how to get field observations across years to demonstrate this though. Having a comparably timed LANDSAT for comparison with HDD climate data could go a long way to build a case in this landscape, but as a reviewer, I'd expect the names for the species that actually behave this way....are these sedges in SC wetlands under the shrubs?
http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav2?theme=MODIS_Forest_Change_Product...
02/19/2015 SPN: MODIS and Landsat respond to majority species cover, and as there may be 20-100 herbaceous species in a MODIS pixel that provide an NDVI contribution, majority cover is the only way to get a grasp of this phenomenon. Among the most common species in wetlands are sedges, and like the hybridized and mowed greener-than-natural grass in your lawn that stays somewhat green through the year but becomes much less so as the winter progresses, sedges have significantly more brown top as they're not mowed that is a bit of an added complexity. In wild parts of Florida, it would likely be Whoknowswhat spp. and/or grass.
02/19/2015 JS: In the south, there is still a fair amount of green vegetation in the winter.  If there is stretch of sunny weather, it can translate to a slight bump up in the greenness level.  I think these slight bump ups in greenness can be seen somewhat looking at the MODIS true color products from one date to another, depending on the region and situation.

"905","Wisconsin Hail Damage","ForWarn change maps show that the forest areas hardest hit were defined by two long-linear storm tracks, 30 km apart and extending for about 200 km across northern Wisconsin.
This storm caused substantial damage in portions of the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest, perhaps in part because many of the deciduous trees still had their leaves making branches more susceptible to breakage. In similar vegetation types in the past, such storm debris can temporarily increase forest fuels and fire hazards (Steve Norman).
","Tuesday, November 4, 2014","Weather","With respect to ForWarn products, the damage appears to start showing up on the Early Detect Adaptive Length Compositing (ED-ALC) change product for the week following the storm (product date ending 9/13), though the detection is during a time when fall colors are starting to show up nearby, especially in areas north and east of the anomalies.  The anomalies are more obvious on the next date of ED-ALC of 9/21 but fall colors are more evident too.  Check out the FCAV URL for viewing the latter: http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav/?theme=MODIS_Forest_Change_Product.... By FCAV product date 9/29, the fall colors dominate the ED-ALC change product, which produces an earlier detection of fall colors relative to the MVC-NDVI change products.
However, at this same date, one can most clearly view the anomalies on the mean of max (MMAX) change with no or minimal influence of the fall colors, starting with date ending 9/29 or 1st date with all current NDVI data that was acquired after the storm (see - http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav/?theme=MODIS_Forest_Change_Product...).  On the MMAX change product, the pattern becomes even more prominent on product date 9/29 - http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav/?theme=MODIS_Forest_Change_Product...
By MMAX NDVI change product date of 10/15, the change from the fall colors become predominant, which suggests we were very lucky to get a MODIS scaled view of the damage at its severest - before the fall color NDVI decline begins to obscure the signal.  For either the ALC or the MVC mean of max change products, there was only a1 week duration of the peak damage detectability, that duration was similar to the ephemeral spring frost damage event in 2007.
On the Forwarn change products, these NDVI drop anomalies appear to be highly evident in particular for Washburn and Sawyer counties, but appear to include the northern portion of Price and Oneida counties.  The pattern suggests linear, variable width streaks of damage of a ~1-20 MODIS pixels wide depending on location, similar to hail streaks but I think more likely due to both straight line winds and hail, based on available news accounts.  These apparent damage streaks trend linearly from NNW to SSE.  This is slightly southward from a due east trajectory.
The impacts in terms of NDVI reduction include portions of the Chequamegon National Forest and a portion of the Saint Croix National Scenic Riverway, though most of the damage is not on Federal Government managed lands – see http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav/?theme=MODIS_Forest_Change_Product....  For a more zoomed in view – see: http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav/?theme=MODIS_Forest_Change_Product....
Note also that you can see the anomaly on portions of the MODIS true color for the same date of 10/7/14 product (in display underlain to the mean of max change for the same date) – see http://forwarn.forestthreats.org/fcav/?theme=MODIS_Forest_Change_Product... – In doing so, toggle off/on the overlain “mmax” change product to see correspondence with the MODIS true color.  Also note that the true color for that date is of very good to excellent quality for the areas with linear streak damage evident on the change product.
I saw on the SAF weekly news email that salvage operations have begun for mitigating timber damage from this storm.  I think that alerts on what ForWarn products are showing should sent out ASAP to folks in the Chequamegon National Forest as an FYI and also WI state forest reps responsible for forest health management. Maybe these could be used to assist assessment and damage mitigation efforts?  Consider also posting a highlight on ForWarn’s web site, perhaps before the FDM folks do something comparable.
In closing, I think this mid-fall MODIS-based detection of regional storm damage in WI is a real good example of mid-fall detection in the far north portion of CONUS where fall colors tend to come earlier in the fall relative areas in other parts of CONUS.  While I did not pull Landsat data, I think this is real solid detection, given the quality of the MODIS true color imagery for the main peak detectability date of 10/7, the fact that it showed up first on the ED-ALC change products and then persisted with MVC mmax change products, and also corroborating news accounts.
